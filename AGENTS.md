# Agent Instructions

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on `goingta/herdr-remote`; use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Guidelines

- Read the project README and any existing docs before making changes
- Run the project's build/test commands before committing (check package.json, Makefile, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml)
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Handle error states explicitly
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility in frontend code
- Follow existing code style and conventions in the repo
- Do not introduce new dependencies without justification

## Verification

- Run linting and type checks before committing
- Run tests relevant to changed code
- Verify the build passes

## Git

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Stage only files related to the current task
- Do not push to main/master without explicit permission
